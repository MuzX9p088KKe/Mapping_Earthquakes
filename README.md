#Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
This project aimed at displaying earthquake data on a map by combining Leaflet and geoJSON data. The boundaries of tectonic plates were also included on the map in order to show a correlation between earthquakes location and their proximity to the boundaries.

## Potential improvements
This project, although it achieved its original goal, could use a few improvements:
- Refactoring the code and cleaning it up is always a good idea
- Adding a more dynamic legend to go with the Major Eartquakes data would help with visualization
- Adding popups for the tectonic plates boundaries may help identify them
- Pushing the all earthquakes above the boundaries by default to put them at the same level.
